For different shaders, we looked into https://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/home.html
For some shaders/parts of code, we referred to the code given in Stanford_Box and the ones uploaded as examples by Sir. 
For textures we used Google Image Search. Also used the Linux convert tool to convert images to tiff from bmp.
We used txmake to generate tex from tiff file.
